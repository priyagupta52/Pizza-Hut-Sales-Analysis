🍕📊 Excited to share my latest Power BI project - a deep dive into Pizza Hut Sales Data 📈🍕

In this project, I harnessed the power of SQL to extract valuable insights from our pizza sales data. 🍕💼 Then, I transformed these raw numbers into compelling visuals using Power BI to provide a holistic view of our pizza business's performance.

📊 My dashboard showcases key performance indicators (KPIs) that matter most:
👉 Total Orders
👉 Total Pizzas Sold
👉 Total Revenue
📅 I've also included a monthly trend analysis, giving us insights into how our business fluctuates throughout the year. 📆

🌞🌜 For a granular perspective, I've delved into daily trends, helping us understand when our pizzas are flying out the door. 📈📉

🍕🍽️ Additionally, I've segmented our pizza offerings by category and revealed which pizza sizes are our top sellers. This knowledge can drive strategic decisions to optimize our menu.

🔍💡 Want to see how I did it? I've documented the queries I used during data exploration, accompanied by output images. This way, you can learn from my approach and apply it to your own data projects!

Let's connect and explore how data-driven insights can revolutionize your business. Together, we can create success, one slice at a time! 🚀🍕
